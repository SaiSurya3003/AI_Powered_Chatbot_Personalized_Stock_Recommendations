Stock Market Prediction and Risk Profiling

Overview

Stock market investment has long been associated with economic growth, offering investors the opportunity to benefit directly from a rising economy. However, despite its potential, uncertainty and lack of financial literacy discourage many individuals from investing in the stock market. According to a recent report by the asset management firm Scrip Box, nearly 76% of individuals in India have only a vague understanding of personal finance. This includes crucial aspects such as risk profiling and investment tools, which ultimately makes them hesitant to enter the stock market.

Objective

This research aims to predict the future value of financial stocks, thereby minimizing uncertainty and encouraging more individuals to participate in the stock market. By implementing effective stock market prediction models and leveraging information retrieval techniques, the study provides recommendations to improve existing solutions while maintaining accuracy and minimizing errors. Additionally, the research proposes a comprehensive and accessible financial planning system.

Methodology

Unlike traditional machine learning algorithms that primarily rely on past values for predictions, this research adopts fundamental analysis as the core approach. Fundamental analysis evaluates key financial factors such as:

Profitability before taxes

Return on taxes

Other essential financial indicators

By integrating risk profiling and stock forecasting into a single platform, this research establishes a one-stop-shop for financial and data analysis. This combined approach enables investors to make well-informed decisions with greater confidence.

Key Features

Stock Market Prediction: Predicts the future value of financial stocks based on fundamental analysis rather than conventional machine learning models.

Risk Profiling: Assesses individual risk tolerance and provides personalized recommendations.

Financial Planning System: Ensures an accessible and reasonable approach for users to plan their investments effectively.

Enhanced Accuracy: Reduces uncertainty by integrating financial indicators rather than solely depending on past trends.

Conclusion

This research presents a novel approach to stock market prediction by focusing on fundamental analysis. By incorporating risk profiling and stock forecasting into a unified platform, the study aims to empower investors with better financial literacy and decision-making tools, ultimately fostering greater participation in the stock market.
